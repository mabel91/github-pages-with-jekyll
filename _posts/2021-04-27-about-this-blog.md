Hello and Welcome to my first blog on GitHub!

##### About Me:
I am a DevOps professional (who was a Developer before :)) and have extensive experience in the Cloud Architecture, Security and Infrastructure domain. I have worked across multiple Cloud Platforms and plan to write about those in future

##### About this blog:
This is a completely hands-on blog and not just reading material. The aim is to go through a series of hands-on labs specifically for DevOps enthusiasts on Microsoft Azure platform.
The labs would be of immense help to any professional looking to bring automation in their work! They are completely free and I am always open to suggestions on the content
